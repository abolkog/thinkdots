## How to Play

1. The game generates a secret color code.
2. Click each dot to select your guess for each position.
3. Submit your guess. You will receive feedback:
   - **Green dot:** Correct color in the correct position
   - **White dot:** Correct color, wrong position
   - **Gray dot:** Color not in the code
4. Use the feedback to refine your next guess.
5. Win by guessing the exact sequence before you run out of attempts!

### Feedback System

- **Easy Mode:**  
  After each guess, you receive feedback for every dot:

  - üü¢ **Green:** Correct color in the correct position.
  - ‚ö™ **White:** Correct color, wrong position.
  - ‚ö´ **Gray:** Color not in the code.

- **Pro Mode:**  
  After each guess, you receive only a summary for the whole row:
  - Example: ‚Äú2 correct, 1 present‚Äù means two colors are correct and in the right position, and one color is correct but in the wrong position. You won‚Äôt know which dots are which.
